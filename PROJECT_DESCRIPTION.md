# Nature Backers — Project Description (Apex Hackathon 2026)

## Summary (100 words)
Nature Backers is a Guardian-powered engagement layer that enables workplaces, events, and communities to participate in verified sustainability projects — not just view them. Built on Hedera and integrated with the Guardian ecosystem, Nature Backers allows participants to discover Guardian-indexed projects and “back” them through symbolic voting, pledges, or expressions of support. The platform extends Indexer consumption patterns by providing structured discovery (SDGs, geography, project type, verification standard) and engagement analytics that can inform future allocation decisions. This project demonstrates how Guardian verification and Hedera infrastructure can support scalable, community-driven sustainability participation.

## Problem
Verified sustainability projects exist in the Guardian ecosystem, but participation is still limited to specialists, issuers, and buyers. Most stakeholders (employees, event attendees, communities, fans) lack a simple, trusted way to engage with verified projects and generate meaningful participation signals.

## Solution
Nature Backers extends Guardian’s verification capabilities into a reusable engagement layer:
- Discover Guardian-indexed projects using structured filters (SDGs, geography, project type, standards)
- Back projects through symbolic, non-financial participation signals
- Record engagement events on Hedera for auditability
- Visualize participation analytics to support transparency and allocation workflows

## Hedera + Guardian Integration
This project leverages:
- Hedera Guardian / Global Indexer (verified sustainability project discovery)
- Indexer client tooling (structured query + normalization utilities)
- Hedera network services (recording participation events and proofs)

## What We Built During the Hackathon
During Apex Hackathon 2026, the team will deliver:
- Modular Indexer client tooling (open source)
- Enhanced project discovery filters and usability improvements
- A streamlined engagement flow for workplace + event participation
- Engagement analytics dashboard and reporting views
- Updated documentation and deployment instructions
