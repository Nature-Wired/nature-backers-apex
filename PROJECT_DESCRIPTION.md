# Nature Backers — Project Description (Apex Hackathon 2026)

## Summary (100 words)
Nature Backers is a Guardian-powered engagement layer that enables workplaces, events, and communities to participate in verified sustainability projects — not just view them. Built on Hedera and integrated with the Guardian ecosystem, Nature Backers allows participants to discover Guardian-indexed projects and “back” them through engagement actions such as voting, pledges, or support signals. For the Apex Hackathon demo, the platform will showcase an event participation flow where attendees connect a wallet, back a verified nature project, and receive a token/NFT proof-of-participation. Nature Backers extends Indexer consumption patterns through structured discovery (SDGs, geography, standards) and engagement analytics.

## Problem
Verified sustainability projects exist in the Guardian ecosystem, but participation is still limited to specialists, issuers, and buyers. Most stakeholders (employees, event attendees, communities) lack an accessible way to engage with trusted projects and generate measurable participation signals that support decision-making, transparency, and future funding.

## Solution
Nature Backers extends Guardian’s verification capabilities into a reusable engagement layer:
- Discover Guardian-indexed projects using structured filters (SDGs, geography, project type, standards)
- Back projects through symbolic, non-financial participation signals
- Record engagement events on Hedera for auditability
- Visualize participation analytics to support transparency and allocation workflows

## Hedera + Guardian Integration
This project leverages:
- Hedera Guardian / Global Indexer (verified sustainability project discovery)
- Indexer client tooling (structured query + normalization utilities)
- Hedera network services (recording participation events and proofs)

## What We Built During the Hackathon
During Apex Hackathon 2026, the team will deliver:
- Modular Indexer client tooling (open source)
- Enhanced project discovery filters and usability improvements
- A streamlined engagement flow for workplace + event participation
- Engagement analytics dashboard and reporting views
- Updated documentation and deployment instructions
