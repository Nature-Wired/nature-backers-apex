# Nature Backers — Apex Hackathon 2026 (Sustainability Track)

**Hackathon Track:** Sustainability  
**Event:** Hedera Hello Future Apex Hackathon 2026  
**Team:** Nature Wired (with ecosystem collaborators TBD)  

## Summary (100 words)
Nature Backers is a Guardian-powered engagement layer that enables workplaces, events, and communities to participate in verified sustainability projects — not just view them. Built on Hedera and integrated with the Guardian ecosystem, Nature Backers allows participants to discover Guardian-indexed projects and “back” them through engagement actions such as voting, pledges, or support signals. For the Apex Hackathon demo, the platform will showcase an event participation flow where attendees connect a wallet, back a verified nature project, and receive a token/NFT proof-of-participation. Nature Backers extends Indexer consumption patterns through structured discovery (SDGs, geography, standards) and engagement analytics.

## Problem
Verified sustainability projects exist in the Guardian ecosystem, but participation is still limited to specialists, issuers, and buyers. Most stakeholders (employees, event attendees, communities) lack an accessible way to engage with trusted projects and generate measurable participation signals that support decision-making, transparency, and future funding.

## Solution
Nature Backers extends Guardian’s verification capabilities into a reusable engagement layer:
- Discover Guardian-indexed projects using structured filters (SDGs, geography, standards)
- Back projects through event-based participation actions
- Connect wallets and issue token/NFT proof-of-participation
- Record engagement events on Hedera for auditability
- Visualize participation analytics to support transparency and allocation workflows

## Hedera + Guardian Integration
This project leverages:
This project leverages:
- Hedera Guardian / Global Indexer (verified project discovery)
- Indexer client tooling (structured query + normalization utilities)
- Hedera Token Service (HTS) (token/NFT participation rewards)
- Hedera network services (recording engagement proofs and activity events)

## What We Built During the Hackathon
This submission builds on the existing Nature Backers MVP foundation. During the Apex Hackathon period, the team will deliver:
- Indexer client modularization and open-source packaging
- Enhanced project discovery filters and usability improvements
- Event participation workflow (QR onboarding + wallet connect)
- Token/NFT proof-of-participation issuance
- Engagement analytics dashboard and reporting views
- Updated documentation and deployment instructions

## Repository Structure
This folder contains hackathon-specific submission artifacts:
- Pitch deck (PDF)
- Demo links
- Architecture notes
- Hackathon-specific implementation notes

## Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)
- Expand event participation modules for real-world pilots
- Add workplace and sponsor engagement workflows
- Improve Indexer query patterns for scalability and performance
- Extend token utility (tiered rewards, reputation, recurring campaigns)
- Support enterprise pilots and ecosystem partner onboarding
