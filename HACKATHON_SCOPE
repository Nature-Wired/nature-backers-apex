# Apex Hackathon 2026 — Hackathon Scope (Nature Backers)

## Project Name
**Nature Backers — Guardian-Powered Engagement Layer for Verified Nature Projects**

## Hackathon Track
**Theme 3: Sustainability**

## Goal of the Hackathon MVP
Build and demo a working MVP that showcases Nature Backers as an engagement layer on top of the Hedera Guardian ecosystem, using a fictitious tech event scenario where attendees can browse verified projects, back a project, and receive an on-chain proof-of-participation token/NFT.

This MVP is focused on participation and transparency, not on financial settlement or marketplace flows.

---

## Demo Scenario (Fictitious Event Use Case)
A tech conference commits to offsetting its event footprint through verified nature-based projects.  
To increase transparency and attendee engagement, the event invites attendees to participate by exploring verified projects and backing the one they want the event to support.

Attendees interact through a simple mobile-friendly experience (QR onboarding).

---

## Core MVP User Flow (Demo Flow)
1. User scans event QR code and opens the Nature Backers event page  
2. User browses verified nature-based sustainability projects  
3. User views project details (SDGs, location, verification info, impact highlights)  
4. User selects a project to “Back”  
5. User connects a wallet (HashPack / Blade / WalletConnect)  
6. User receives a token/NFT proof-of-participation  
7. Organizer dashboard updates to show backing results and engagement analytics

## Must-Have Features (Hackathon MVP)
### 1. Event Participation UX (Front End)
- Event landing page
- Project browse / listing view
- Project detail view
- Back / vote action flow
- Confirmation view

### 2. Verified Project Data Integration
- Pull project listings from Guardian Indexer / Global Indexer  
  OR
- Use a “lite” integration approach for verified project data if Indexer access is limited

### 3. Wallet Integration (NEW)
- Wallet connect experience for participants
- Display connected wallet address / session

### 4. Token / NFT Proof-of-Participation (NEW)
- Mint or issue a participation token/NFT when a project is backed
- Token/NFT metadata should include:
  - Event name
  - Project name / ID
  - Timestamp
  - SDG tags (if available)

### 5. Engagement Analytics Dashboard
- Live project backing totals
- Simple leaderboard / ranking view
- Analytics breakdown by:
  - Project
  - SDG
  - Region (if available)

---

## Nice-to-Have Features (If Time Allows)
### AI Layer (Optional)
- AI-based project recommendation based on attendee preferences
  OR
- AI-based summary generation (turn project metadata into a short human-readable story)

### Admin / Organizer Export
- Export backing results to CSV
- Export simple event report summary

### Multi-Event Support
- Ability to define an event campaign ID and filter engagement by event

---

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Not Built in Hackathon MVP)
- Stablecoin settlement or purchasing offsets directly
- Marketplace flows (buy/sell/retire credits)
- Compliance or registry integration beyond Guardian project discovery
- Full identity / KYC onboarding
- Advanced tokenomics or speculative reward mechanics

---

## Technical Scope Notes
### Existing Foundation (Reuse)
This hackathon submission builds on the existing Nature Backers MVP foundation, including:
- AWS-hosted backend services
- Existing GitHub codebase and architecture patterns
- Prior Indexer client work and query documentation
- Existing UI concepts and Figma designs

### New Development Areas
Hackathon-specific additions include:
- Wallet connection workflow
- HTS token/NFT issuance logic
- Event-based UX flow implementation
- Minimal analytics reporting views

---

## Definition of Done (Hackathon Completion Criteria)
The submission is considered complete if the team can demonstrate:

- A working live deployment with event participation UI
- Verified project listings visible in the app
- Wallet connect works end-to-end
- Backing a project triggers token/NFT issuance
- Dashboard updates and shows results
- GitHub repo includes clear documentation + deployment instructions
- A recorded demo video and pitch deck are included

---

## Expected Submission Artifacts
- GitHub repo (public)
- Working demo URL
- Demo video (YouTube)
- Pitch deck PDF
- README with setup + testing instructions
- Hackathon-specific documentation (this file, architecture notes, etc.)

---

## Post-Hackathon Roadmap
- Expand to workplace participation campaigns
- Add sponsor participation modules
- Add recurring participation incentives and reputation
- Improve Indexer query patterns and open-source Indexer tooling
- Add stablecoin settlement for real-world event offset funding
